. Create a MIPS data section that declares variables equivalent to the following.  This will not be a runnable program without a main.
+
[source,c,linenums]
----
	float a;
	float b = 2.71;
	int myarray[10] = { 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 };
	short array2[10];

	char mips_str[] = "MIPS assembly is awesome!";
----

. How would you declare an array of 500 points?  The point structure is tightly
packed and defined like this:
+
[source,c,linenums]
----
struct point {
	float x;
	float y;
	float z;
};
----
