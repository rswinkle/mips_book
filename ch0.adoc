== Chapter 0: Hello World

In which we lay the groundwork for the rest of the book...

=== Prereqs

While someone with no programming experience could probably learn MIPS from this
book, it is definitely preferable to have at least some experience in a higher
level imperative programming language. I say imperative, because programming
in assembly is the antithesis of functional programming; everything is about
state, with each line changing the state of the CPU and sometimes memory. Given
that, experience in functional languages like Lisp, Scheme etc. are less helpful
than experience in C/C{plus}{plus}, Java, Python, Javascript etc.

Of all of the latter, C is the best, with C{plus}{plus} being a close second because at least
all of C exists in C{plus}{plus}. There are many reasons C is the best prior experience when
learning assembly (any assembly, not just MIPS), including the following:

* pointers, concepts and symmetry of "address of" and "dereference" operators
* pointer/array syntax equivalence
* stack allocation as the default
* manual memory management, no garbage collector
* global data
* rough equivalence in structure of a C program and an assembly program (vs. say Java)
* pass by value

There is some overlap between those and there are probably more, but you can see that
most other languages that are commonly taught as first languages are missing most, if
not all of those things.

Even C{plus}{plus}, which technically has all of them, being a superset of C,
is usually taught in a way that mostly ignores all of those things.  They teach
C{plus}{plus} as if it's Java, never teaching the fundamentals. In any case this
is getting into my problems with CS pedagogy of the last 20 years based on my
experience as a CS major myself ('12) and as a programming tutor helping college
students across the country since 2016, and I should save it for a proper
essay/rant sometime.

Long story short, I use C code and C syntax to help explain and teach MIPS.  I'll
try to provide enough explanation regardless of past experience as best I can.

=== System Setup

As I tell all of my tutoring students, if you're majoring in CS or anything related
I highly recommend you use Linux. It's easier in every way to do dev work
on Linux vs Windows or Mac.  Many assignments require it, which often necessitates
using a virtual machine (which is painful, especially on laptops) and/or ssh-ing
into a school Linux server, which is also less than ideal.  In general, you'll have
to learn how to use the unix terminal eventually and will probably use it to some
extent in your career so it also makes sense to get used to it asap.

That being said, Windows does now have WSL so you can get the full Ubuntu or Debian
or Fedora etc. terminal based system on Windows without having to setup a real
virtual machine (or dealing with the slowdown that would cause). I've even heard
that they'll get support for Linux GUI programs soon.

MacOS on the other hand, is technically a Unix based system and you can use their
terminal and install virtually any program from there using Macports or Homebrew
or similar.

There are 3 commonly used MIPS simulators that I know of:

* SPIM is probably the oldest and is terminal only
* QtSpim is a GUI front end for SPIM
* MARS is a Java GUI based simulator with dozens of extra syscalls, syntactic
sugar and features like graphics, memory mapped I/O, etc.

SPIM and QtSpim are in the Debian/Ubuntu repos so you can install them with the following

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo apt install qtspim spim
----

You can probably find them in the repos for other distros too and install them similarly.

If it's not in your repos or you're on Windows (and not using WSL) or Mac you can
download them, and MARS at these addresses

=== Handy Resources

There are a few references that you should bookmark (or download) before you get started.
The first is the
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rswinkle/mips_book/master/references/MIPS_Green_Sheet.pdf[MIPS Greensheet].
It's likely you already have a physical copy of this as it's actually the tearout from the Patterson
and Hennessey textbook https://amzn.to/3zN71KP[_Computer Architecture and Design_]
that is commonly used in college courses.

The second thing is the list of https://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/mars/Help/SyscallHelp.html[syscalls]
from the MARS website.

I recommend you download/bookmark both and keep them open while working because
you'll be referencing them often to remind yourself which instructions and syscalls
you have available and how they work.

=== Hello World

Let's start with the classic hello world program, first in C, then in MIPS, and go
over all the pieces in overview.  You can copy paste these into your editor of choice
(mine being neovim), or use the files in the associated repo to follow along.

[source,c,linenums]
----
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	printf("Hello World!\n");
	return 0;
}
----

It is pretty self explanatory.  You have to include stdio.h so you can use the
function printf (though in the real world I'd use puts here), the function main
is the start of any C/C{plus}{plus} program, which is a function that returns
an int.  We call printf to display the string "Hello World!\n" to the user and
then return 0 to exit.  Returning 0 indicates success and there were no errors.

You can compile and run it in a linux/unix terminal as shown below.  You
can substitute clang or another compiler for gcc if you want.

[source,bash]
----
$ gcc -o hello hello.c
$ ./hello
Hello World!
----

Now, the same program in MIPS:

[source,mips,linenums]
----
.data
hello:   .asciiz "Hello World!\n"

.text
main:
	li   $v0, 4      # load immediate, v0 = 4 (4 is print string system call)
	la   $a0, hello  # load address of string to print into a0
	syscall

	li   $v0, 10     # exit syscall
	syscall
----

The `.data` section is where you declare global variables, which includes string
literals as in this case.  We'll cover them in more detail later.

The `.text` section is where any code goes.  Here we declare a single label `main:`,
indicating the start of our main function.

We then put the number 4 in the `$v0` register to select the print string system
call.  The print string system call takes one argument, the address of the string
to print, in the `$a0` register.  We do that on the next line. On line 8, we call
the system call using the syscall instruction.

Finally we call the exit system call which takes no arguments and exits the program.

Again, we'll cover system calls in a later chapter.  This is just an intro/overview
so don't worry if some things aren't completely clear.  This chapter is about getting
you up and running, not really about teaching anything specific yet.

=== Building and Running

Now that we have our hello world MIPS program, how do we run it?  Well the easiest
and quickest{mars_slow} way is of course to do it on the command line, which can be done like
this for spim:

[source,bash]
----
$ spim -file hello.s
SPIM Version 8.0 of January 8, 2010
Copyright 1990-2010, James R. Larus.
All Rights Reserved.
See the file README for a full copyright notice.
Loaded: /usr/lib/spim/exceptions.s
Hello World!
----

or this for MARS:

[source,bash]
----
$ java -jar ~/Mars4_5.jar hello.s
MARS 4.5  Copyright 2003-2014 Pete Sanderson and Kenneth Vollmar

Hello World!

----

The name of your MARS jar file may be different{mars_versions}, so be sure to
use the correct name and path.  For myself, I keep the jar file in my home
directory so I can use tilde to access it no matter where I am.  You can also
copy it into your working directory (ie wherever you have your source code) so you
don't have to specify a path at all.  There are lots of useful command line options
that you can use{mars_commandline}, some of which we'll touch on later.

Running the jar directly on the command line works even in the DOS command line though
I've never done it and it's probably not worth it.

Alternatively, you can start up MARS or QtSpim like a normal GUI application and
then load your source file.  MARS requires you to hit "assemble" and then "run".
Whereas with QtSpim you only have to hit "run".

QtSpim does let you start and load the file in one step from the command line

[source,bash]
----
$ qtspim hello.s
----

but there is no way to simply run it with out starting the GUI, which makes sense
since the whole point is to be a GUI wrapper around spim.

=== Conclusion

Well, there you have it, you have written and run your first MIPS program.  Another
few chapters and you will have no trouble with almost anything you would want
to do in MIPS, whether for a class, or on your own for fun.
