== Chapter 1: Data

In MIPS, you can declare global variables in the `.data` section.

At a minimum, this is where you would declare/define any literal strings
your program will be printing, since virtually every program has
at least 1 or 2 of those.

When declaring something in the `.data` section, the format is

`variable_name: .directive value(s)`

where whitespace between the 3 is arbitrary.  The possible directives are listed
in the following table:

.MIPS data types
[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
| Directive | Size | C equivalent

| .byte | 1 | char

| .half | 2 | short

| .word | 4 | int, all pointer types

| .float | 4 | float

| .double | 8 | double

| .ascii | NA | char str[5] = "hello"; (no '\0')

| .asciiz | NA | char str[] = "hello"; (includes the '\0')

| .space  | NA | typeless, unitinialized space, can be used for any type/array
|===


As you can see it's pretty straightforward, but there are a few more details
about actually using them so let's move onto some examples.

Say you wanted to convert the following simple program to MIPS:

[source,c,linenums]
----
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	char name[30];
	int age;
	printf("What's your name and age?\n");
	scanf("%s %d", name, &age);
	printf("Hello %s, nice to meet you!\n", name);
	return 0;
}
----

The first thing you have to remember when converting from a higher level language
to assembly (any assembly), is that what matters is whether it is functionally
the same, not whether everything is done in exactly the same way.{what_matters}
In this instance, that means realizing that your literal strings and your local
variables `name` and `age` become globals in MIPS.

[source,mips,linenums]
----
.data
age:         .word 0  # can be initialized to anything

ask_name:    .asciiz "What's your name and age?\n"
hello_space: .asciiz "Hello "
nice_meet:   .asciiz ", nice to meet you!\n"

name:        .space 30

.text

# main goes here

----

As you can see in the example, we extract all the string literals and
the character array `name` and int `age` and declare them as MIPS globals.
One thing to note is the second `printf`.  Because it prints a variable, `name`,
using the conversion specifier, we break the literal into pieces around that.
Since there is no built-in `printf` function in MIPS, you have to handle printing
variables yourself with the appropriate system calls.


=== Arrays

Obviously strings are special cases that can be handled with `.ascii` or `.asciiz`
for literals, but for other types or user inputed strings how do we do it?

The first way, which was demonstrated in the snippet above is to use `.space`
to declare an array of the necessary byte size.  Keep in mind that the size is
specified in bytes not elements, so it only matches for character arrays.  For
arrays of ints/words, floats, doubles etc. you'd have to multiply by the sizeof(type).

"But, `.space` only lets you declare uninitialized arrays, how do I do initialized ones?"

Actually, it appears `.space` initializes everything to 0 similar to global/static
data in C and C{plus}{plus}, though I can't find that documented anywhere.

Aside from that, there are two ways depending on whether you want to initialize
every element to the same value or not.

For different values, the syntax is an extension of declaring a single variable
of that type.  You specify all the values, comma separated.  This actually gives
you another way to declare a string or a character array, though I can't really
think of a reason you'd want to.  You could declare a `.byte` array and list all
the characters individually.

However, if you want an array with all elements initialized to the same value there
is a more convenient option.  After the type you put the value you want, a colon,
and then the number of elements.  So `a: .word 123 : 10`
would declare a 10 integer array with all elements set to 123.  This works for all
types in MARS, but SPIM does not support this syntax for floats and doubles.  Since
you'll probably not have to deal with floating point types at all, let alone arrays
of them initialized to a particular value, this isn't a huge loss.

Given what we just covered, this:

[source,c,linenums]
----
int a[20];
double b[20];
int c[10] = { 9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0 };
int d[5] = { 42, 42, 42, 42, 42 };
char e[3] = { 'a', 'b', 'c' };
----

becomes

[source,mips,linenums]
----
.data
a:        .space 80
b:        .space 160
c:        .word 9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0
d:        .word 42 : 5
e:        .byte 'a', 'b', 'c'
----

You don't have to understand the rest of the code, just that it prints out each of the arrays.
